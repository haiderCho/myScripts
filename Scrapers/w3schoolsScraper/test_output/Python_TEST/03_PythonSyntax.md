## Execute Python Syntax

As we learned in the previous page, Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line:

>>> print("Hello, World!")  
Hello, World! 

Or by creating a python file on the server, using the .py file extension, and running it in the Command Line:

C:\Users\_Your Name_ >python myfile.py

## Python Indentation

Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.

Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

### Example

if 5 > 2:  
print("Five is greater than two!") 

[Try it Yourself »](trypython.asp?filename=demo_indentation)

Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation:

### Example

Syntax Error:

if 5 > 2:  
print("Five is greater than two!") 

[Try it Yourself »](trypython.asp?filename=demo_indentation_test)

The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, the most common use is four, but it has to be at least one.

### Example

if 5 > 2:  
print("Five is greater than two!")   
if 5 > 2:  
print("Five is greater than two!") 

[Try it Yourself »](trypython.asp?filename=demo_indentation2)

You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise Python will give you an error:

### Example

Syntax Error:

if 5 > 2:  
print("Five is greater than two!")   
print("Five is greater than two!")

## Python Variables

In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to it: 

### Example

Variables in Python:

x = 5  
y = "Hello, World!" 

[Try it Yourself »](trypython.asp?filename=demo_syntax_variables)

Python has no command for declaring a variable.

You will learn more about variables in the [ Python Variables](python_variables.asp) chapter.

## Comments

Python has commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation.

Comments start with a `#`, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment: 

### Example

Comments in Python:

#This is a comment.  
print("Hello, World!")
