## Get Started With Python

At W3Schools, you can try Python without installing anything.

Our Online Python Editor runs directly in your browser, and shows both the code and the result:

### Example

print("Hello, World!") 

[Try it Yourself »](trypython.asp?filename=demo_helloworld)

This editor will be used in the entire tutorial to demonstrate the different aspects of Python.

## Python Install

However, if you want to run Python on your own computer, follow the instructions below.

Many Windows PCs and Mac computers already have Python pre-installed.

To check if Python is installed on Windows, search in the start bar for Python or run the following on the Command Line (cmd.exe):

C:\Users\_Your Name_ >python --version 

To check if you have python installed on a Linux or Mac, then on linux open the command line or on Mac open the Terminal and type:

python --version 

If Python is not installed on your computer, you can download it for free from the official website: <https://www.python.org/>

## Python Quickstart

Python is an interpreted programming language, this means that as a developer you write Python (.py) files in a text editor and then put those files into the python interpreter to be executed.

Let's write our first Python file, called `hello.py`, which can be done in any text editor:

`hello.py`:
    
    
    print("Hello, World!")
    

Simple as that. Save your file. Open your command line, navigate to the directory where you saved your file, and run:

C:\Users\_Your Name_ >python hello.py 

The output should be:

Hello, World! 

Congratulations, you have written and executed your first Python program.

## Python Version

To check the Python version of the editor, you can find it by importing the `sys` module:

### Example

Check the Python version of the editor:

import sys  
  
print(sys.version) 

[Try it Yourself »](trypython.asp?filename=demo_sys_version)

You will learn more about importing modules in our [Python Modules](python_modules.asp) chapter.

## The Python Command Line

To test a short amount of code in python sometimes it is quickest and easiest not to write the code in a file. This is made possible because Python can be run as a command line itself.

Type the following on the Windows, Mac or Linux command line:

C:\Users\_Your Name_ >python 

Or, if the "python" command did not work, you can try "py": 

C:\Users\_Your Name_ >py 

From there you can write any python code, including our hello world example from earlier in the tutorial:

C:\Users\_Your Name_ >python  
Python 3.6.4 (v3.6.4:d48eceb, Dec 19 2017, 06:04:45) [MSC v.1900 32 bit (Intel)] on win32  
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.  
>>> print("Hello, World!") 

Which will write "Hello, World!" in the command line:

C:\Users\_Your Name_ >python  
Python 3.6.4 (v3.6.4:d48eceb, Dec 19 2017, 06:04:45) [MSC v.1900 32 bit (Intel)] on win32  
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.  
>>> print("Hello, World!")  
Hello, World! 

Whenever you are done in the python command line, you can simply type the following to quit the python command line interface:

exit()
